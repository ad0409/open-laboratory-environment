# Open Laboratory Environment (OLE)

## Attention:
### As of 13.1.2022 this is still a work in progress. While this project is already online (to be able to work on by the developers), the project is not yet launched, thus in ALPHA Status.

<b><i>OLE</i></b> is an integral approach to combine Hard- & Software in a standardized, open-source environment. It is a middleware concept that aims at automating laboratory equipment, while not being limited to specific hardware or ecosystems. The main intention behind automation is collecting standardized data, which then is directly transferred into a connected database, already including a meta-data structure. This way, data stays long-time available, can be reused, compared or can be reevaluated using new approaches (ie. New methods, algorithms or AI)

On this page, you will find:
-	Code to setup your own <b><i>OLE</i></b>
-	Suggestions for Hardware
-	Community Examples
-	[A Wiki with additional information](https://github.com/ad0409/open-laboratory-environment/wiki).

<b><i>OLE</i></b> aims to offer high hardware-compatibility. It is desired to benefit from the community based open-source guiding principle, rather than making the idea incompatible and proprietary. Therefore, the complete source code, tutorials, build instructions and multimedia-data is published here. This project hopes to spark discussions, engagement and ideas for improvement within the community.

## A brief history:
<b><i>OLE</i></b> was propose by P. Mattern [Diabetes Competence Centre Karlsburg (KDK), Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology (INP)] in June 2021 and was first presented to the public at the “11th Workshop of Chemical and Biological Micro Laboratory Technology” in March 2022 in Elgersburg, Germany. A first working demonstrator was designed by A. Falke [EUREGIO BioMedtech Center, Fachhochschule Münster] during his Bachelor thesis in 2021 at KDK.
