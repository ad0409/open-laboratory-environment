Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in modern societies. As a result, the need for standardized data is growing massively. This repository is a guide to build a prototype for standardized, automated data acquisition. It is intended to demonstrate how such data can be generated at low cost and with little effort. The prototype is the first development stage of a concept called <b><i>Open Laboratory Environment (OLE)</i></b>. In this first stage, a 3D printer and a computing unit are modified into a 3D traversing system with parallel temperature logging. For this, open-source software such as the <b><i>UNIX</i></b>-based operating system <b><i>Ubuntu</i></b>, the <b><i>Robot Operating System (ROS)</i></b> framework, and <b><i>Python</i></b> programming language are applied. A first working prototype is the result. 


Both the prototype and the <b><i>OLE</i></b> are developed to offer high hardware-compatibility. It is desired to benefit from the community based open-source guiding principle, rather than making the idea incompatible and proprietary. Therefore, the complete source code, tutorials, build instructions and multimedia-data is published here. This project hopes to spark discussions, engagement and ideas for improvement within the community.

## Basic requirements
Here you find information about the Setup for the project. Used Hard- and Software is listed below. For detailed implementation info have a look at (link1) and (link2).
### Hardware used
* [Up squared maker Board](https://up-board.org/upsquared/specifications/)
* [Ultimaker 2 Extended 3d printer](https://ultimaker.com/) 

### Software used
* [Latest Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)
  * Several libraries
* [Robot operation system (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/)


### Ubuntu 20.04
Here you find information about setting up the software.
Latest Linux distribution Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) was installed on Up squared as described [here](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#install-ubuntu-for-up-up-squared-up-core-up-core-plus-up-xtreme-and-up-squared-pro). Latest desktop version was [installed](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#install-ubuntu-for-up-up-squared-up-core-up-core-plus-up-xtreme-and-up-squared-pro) after downloading it from the Ubuntu page. 

Before installing new software always keep your system up to date with:
```
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt update
```


### Robot Operation System (ROS)
ROS noetic was installed on Ubuntu core like [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

### Pycharm community
Latest version of open source IDE [Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com) was installed.
