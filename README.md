### Ubuntu 20.04
Here you find information about setting up the software.
Latest Linux distribution Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) was installed on Up squared as described [here](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#install-ubuntu-for-up-up-squared-up-core-up-core-plus-up-xtreme-and-up-squared-pro). Latest desktop version was [installed](https://github.com/up-board/up-community/wiki/Ubuntu_20.04#install-ubuntu-for-up-up-squared-up-core-up-core-plus-up-xtreme-and-up-squared-pro) after downloading it from the Ubuntu page. 

Before installing new software always keep your system up to date with:
```
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt update
```
